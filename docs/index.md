# Privacy Policy

**Material Photo Widget** is an open source app provided by Filipe Belatti and distributed on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fibelatti.photowidget) at no cost. It is intended for use _as is_.

**Material Photo Widget does not collect any personal information**, either directly or through third-party services. Photos and folders selected for each widget are chosen using the native Android picker and are stored locally on your device. All widget settings are also stored on-device. No additional data is collected, stored, or transmitted. The app does not include any form of analytics or usage tracking.

Please note that **Android itself may collect anonymized crash or ANR (Application Not Responding) reports** beyond the developer’s control. These reports can include crash logs and basic device information, but are anonymized and cannot personally identify you.

## App Permissions

- `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`
  Required to restore widgets after a device restart. Some device manufacturers may block this by default. You might need to enable it manually via your device's "auto-start" or similar setting.

- `android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`
  Optional. Grants the app the ability to update widget photos at precise intervals, ensuring they follow your selected schedule exactly.

## User Support

Widgets operate as a separate process from the app and are hosted by your home screen launcher. This means they may be affected by the device manufacturer’s customizations or the specific launcher you use. Consequently, some features may not work as expected on all devices.

If you experience any issues, feel free to contact me via the **App support** option available on the Google Play listing. I’ll do my best to assist you.

## Community-Driven Translations

Translations are managed via a community-driven effort on [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/material-photo-widget). Contributions are welcome—whether you'd like to add a new language or correct an existing translation.

If you encounter any offensive content or issues in a translation, please contact me immediately using the **App support** link in the Play Store listing.
